# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

trigger:
  # batch = true so not every commit triggers the build
  batch: 'true'
  branches:
    include:
    - master
  paths:
    # include all paths as trigger for changes
    include:
    - .
pool:
  vmImage: 'Ubuntu-20.04'

variables:
  template: /build/pipelines/variables/contentwebapi-variables.yaml
  solution: '**/*.sln'
  buildConfiguration: 'Release'
  runtime: 'win-x64'  
  ProjectsToTest: "src/Content.Commands.Tests/**/*.Tests.csproj"
