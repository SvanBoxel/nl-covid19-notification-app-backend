# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

trigger:
  # batch = true so not every commit triggers the build
  batch: 'true'
  branches:
    include:
    - master
  paths:
    # include all paths as trigger for changes
    include:
    - .
pool:
  vmImage: 'Ubuntu-20.04'

variables:
  solution: '**/*.sln'
  buildConfiguration: 'Release'
  runtime: 'win-x64'
  Content.WebApi.ProjectsToBuildAndPublish: "src/Content.WebApi/**/*.csproj"
  ProjectsToTest: "**/*.Tests.csproj"

stages:
# test, sonar
- template: /build/pipelines/stages/test-stage.yaml

# Publish build and push content.webapi stage
- stage: Build
  dependsOn: Test

    - job: Build
