# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:

trigger:
  # batch = true so not every commit triggers the build
  batch: 'true'
  branches:
    include:
    - '59725'
  paths:
    # include all paths as trigger for changes
    include:
    - .
